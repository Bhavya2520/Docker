# Docker Basics

## Docker, the Company
1.	Docker, Inc. is the name of the company behind the Docker project.  
2.	It started as a Platform as a Service (PaaS) company called dotCloud, but pivoted and rebranded to Docker, Inc. in 2013.  
3.	Their main focus is container technologies.  

## Docker, the Technology
1.	Docker is an open-source technology that Docker, Inc. developed.  
2.	It's designed to make it easier for developers to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers.  
3.	Containers package an application and its dependencies together, making the application easily runnable on any system that has Docker installed.  
4.	We can install Docker on any O.S but the Docker engine runs natively on Linux distribution.  
5.	Docker is written in the ‚ÄòGO‚Äô language.  

## Containerization Before Docker
1.	Although the concept of containerization wasn't new, Docker popularized it with a simpler, more efficient approach.  
2.	Previous technologies like Linux Containers (LXC) laid the groundwork, but Docker made containers more accessible and easier to use.  

## which problems solves by docker ?

‚úÖ 1. ‚ÄúIt works on my machine‚Äù Problem  
‚Ä¢	Issue: Code runs on one machine but fails on another due to different environments.  
‚Ä¢	Docker Solution: Docker containers package the application with all its dependencies, ensuring consistent behavior across environments (development, testing, production).  
________________________________________  
‚úÖ 2. Environment Configuration  
‚Ä¢	Issue: Setting up development environments is time-consuming and error-prone.  
‚Ä¢	Docker Solution: Docker allows you to define the environment in a single Dockerfile, making setup easy and replicable.  
________________________________________  
‚úÖ 3. Dependency Management  
‚Ä¢	Issue: Conflicts due to different versions of libraries, runtimes, or tools.  
‚Ä¢	Docker Solution: Containers include their own dependencies, avoiding conflicts with other applications or host OS.  
________________________________________  
‚úÖ 4. Portability  
‚Ä¢	Issue: Applications behave differently on different platforms.  
‚Ä¢	Docker Solution: Docker containers run the same way on Linux, Windows, macOS, or cloud, making apps truly portable.  
________________________________________  
‚úÖ 5. Resource Isolation  
‚Ä¢	Issue: Running multiple apps on the same system causes interference.  
‚Ä¢	Docker Solution: Containers are isolated from each other and the host system, preventing resource conflicts.  
________________________________________  
‚úÖ 6. Scalability & Microservices  
‚Ä¢	Issue: Monolithic apps are hard to scale and maintain.  
‚Ä¢	Docker Solution: Docker encourages microservices architecture‚Äîbreaking apps into smaller services that can be scaled independently.  
________________________________________  
‚úÖ 7. Faster Development and Deployment  
‚Ä¢	Issue: Setting up environments, testing, and deployment takes time.  
‚Ä¢	Docker Solution: Containers can be built and deployed quickly, speeding up CI/CD pipelines.  
________________________________________  
‚úÖ 8. Version Control for Environments  
‚Ä¢	Issue: No way to track environment changes like code.  
‚Ä¢	Docker Solution: Dockerfiles and images act like version-controlled snapshots of environments.  
________________________________________  
‚úÖ 9. Easy Rollback  
‚Ä¢	Issue: Rolling back to a previous working version can be hard.  
‚Ä¢	Docker Solution: You can maintain multiple versions of images and revert easily.  
________________________________________  
‚úÖ 10. Security & Isolation  
‚Ä¢	Issue: Applications may expose the host OS to vulnerabilities.  
‚Ä¢	Docker Solution: Containers run in isolated environments, reducing the attack surface.  
________________________________________  
‚úÖ 11. Simplified CI/CD  
‚Ä¢	Issue: Different CI/CD environments can cause failures.  
‚Ä¢	Docker Solution: Docker integrates seamlessly with CI/CD tools (like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) for consistent builds and tests.  
________________________________________  
‚úÖ 12. Infrastructure as Code  
‚Ä¢	Issue: Manual infrastructure setup is error-prone.  
‚Ä¢	Docker Solution: Docker Compose allows infrastructure setup using YAML files, making it automated and reproducible.  

## üö´ Disadvantages of Docker (Short Notes)
1.	No GUI Support  
Not suitable for applications with rich graphical interfaces.  
2.	Hard to Manage Many Containers  
Becomes complex without tools like Kubernetes.  
3.	Limited Cross-Platform  
Windows containers don‚Äôt run on Linux and vice versa.  
4.	Needs VM on Windows/macOS  
Docker runs slower because it uses a VM on non-Linux systems.  
5.	No Built-in Backup  
Data recovery and backup must be done manually.  
6.	Not a Full OS  
Can‚Äôt replace VMs if different OS kernels are needed.  
7.	Security Risks  
Containers share the same OS kernel, increasing risk if misconfigured.  
8.	Persistent Storage is Tricky  
Data can be lost if volumes are not properly managed.  


## Why Docker is Lightweight?

The OS has two main components:  
1) **Kernel** ‚Äì talks with hardware  
2) **Shell** ‚Äì two types: either GUI-based (Windows) or CLI-based (Linux)  

Ubuntu, RedHat have a common kernel; the difference is only in the Shell component.

A **Virtual Machine** is the same as a physical machine,  
So each virtual machine also includes its own kernel and shell.

---

**Scenario:**  
You have a Docker image of Ubuntu and your host OS is Windows.  
We‚Äôve already stated that a Docker container has **no kernel**.  
So how is the Ubuntu image able to run using the Windows kernel?

---

### üß† Explanation:
A Docker container uses the **kernel of the host OS**.

But the Ubuntu image needs a **Linux kernel**, and your host is **Windows**.

So, Docker Desktop (on Windows) starts a **lightweight Linux VM** using **WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2)** or **Hyper-V**.

The Ubuntu container then runs **inside that Linux VM**, using the **Linux kernel**.

But in the case of Docker containers, we use the **kernel of the main operating system**,  
and each container only contains the **shell**,  
so the **container becomes lightweight**.

---

### Summary:

- **Virtual Machine** = shares hardware (hardware virtualization)  
- **Containers** = share kernel (OS virtualization)  
- **Virtual Machine** size: in **GBs**  
- **Docker**: within **MBs**

## Virtual Machine vs Container

### Virtual Machine

A **hypervisor** is used to run virtual machines.  
Containers don‚Äôt need a hypervisor directly ‚Äî but on systems like **Windows** or **macOS**, Docker uses a hypervisor (via **WSL2** or **Hyper-V**) to create a Linux VM, so containers can access a Linux kernel.

There are many hypervisors available in the market.

- **VMware hypervisor** is known as **ESXi**.  
- Similarly, **Microsoft** has also developed a hypervisor: **Hyper-V**

### üß† Virtual Machine vs Container

| Feature | üñ•Ô∏è Virtual Machine (VM) | üì¶ Container (Docker, etc.) |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Isolation** | Fully isolated with own OS | Isolated but share host OS kernel |
| **OS Requirement** | Has its own full OS (guest OS) | Shares the host OS kernel |
| **Startup Time** | Slow (minutes) | Fast (seconds) |
| **Resource Usage** | Heavy (more RAM, CPU, storage) | Lightweight (uses fewer resources) |
| **Performance** | Slower due to full OS overhead | Near-native performance |
| **Storage Size** | Large (several GBs per VM) | Small (MBs to hundreds of MBs) |
| **Portability** | Less portable (hardware/OS dependencies) | Highly portable across environments |
| **Boot Time** | Longer (must boot OS) | Very fast (no full OS boot) |
| **Hypervisor Needed** | ‚úÖ Yes (e.g., VirtualBox, Hyper-V, VMware) | ‚ùå No (uses container runtime like Docker Engine) |
| **Use Cases** | Run multiple OSs, legacy systems, kernel-level tasks | Microservices, app isolation, fast deployments |
| **Security** | Stronger isolation (separate OS) | Weaker (shared kernel, needs extra hardening) |
| **Example Technologies** | VMware, VirtualBox, Hyper-V, KVM | Docker, containerd, Podman |
